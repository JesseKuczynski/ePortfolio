  <h2>Software Engineering &amp; Design</h2>

  <p>
    This artifact was a webpage application for a resort company named Travlr Getaways. It was pulled from my CS-465 Full Stack Development course. The final project was created in June of 2025. The application itself is comprised of Angular front end with a Node.js/Express API backend through MongoDB. The original code supported listed trip cards that customers could browse through without the action of booking a trip itself.
  </p>

  <p>
I selected this project for Software Engineering and Design because there are multiple examples within the original code that showcases full end-to-end development and design through database modeling, client-server integration, user authentication, and debugging. It is relevant to the sort of software that I aim to build as a career developer. The specific components of the artifact demonstrating my capabilities in software development include both client side and server side. On the client side, I designed and created an Angular UI that utilizes reactive forms, route navigations, and validation to create a booking form with adjustable pricing depending on the value placed in the traveler’s field. This interface speaks to the Node/Express API that was extended to include a dedicated bookings database with CORS and preflight handling. The database was modeled in MongoDB with Mongoose that links the bookings to the trips through an object reference. The booking flow is integrated with the pre-existing JWT authentication in the original code that holds secure paths for admins to continue maintenance and updates as needed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Within my original enhancement plan, my aim was to have the enhancement for this Full Stack artifact to cover what the second course outcome is, which is Designing, developing, and delivering professional-quality oral, written, and visual communication. Reflecting on the work I have performed and all that I have done with this enhancement, I have met that goal and touched on other course outcomes as well. The polish done to the UI with clear messages and validation meets the goal of communications toward both technical and non-technical individuals. Creating a new end-to-end feature that goes through Angular, Express, and Mongo showcases software engineering and design. Creating a new Bookings collection through MongoDB that stores successfully submitted booking forms addresses the course outcome for data. I upheld a security mindset through keeping the JWT admin paths and configuring CORS and the required preflight.
  </p>

  <p>
  Reflecting on the process that I went through modifying and enhancing this artifact, I was harshly reminded that development with full stack is very much pass or fail. The slightest hiccup could and has brought the entire service down. Through my attempts to test and successfully submit a booking form, I continued to receive a repeating error. It wasn’t until I had pulled up the DevTools and looked through all the logs of traffic while navigating and testing a form submission that the error in question was due to an unhandled CORS preflight. This was addressed by adding CORS to the api path.
  </p>

  <p>
    What I had learned was the binding minDate with a validator for the date input. Which in practice, ensured that no date beyond the current calendar day could be used for scheduling purposes in the booking form itself when a form is being filled. If the attempt to use a day prior to the current calendar day is used, the button for submitting the form will become inactive and unable to push the notification until the correction is made.
