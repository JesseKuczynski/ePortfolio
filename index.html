  <h2>Software Engineering &amp; Design</h2>

  <p>
    This artifact was a webpage application for a resort company named Travlr Getaways. It was pulled from my CS-465 Full Stack Development course. The final project was created in June of 2025. The application itself is comprised of Angular front end with a Node.js/Express API backend through MongoDB. The original code supported listed trip cards that customers could browse through without the action of booking a trip itself.
  </p>

  <p>
I selected this project for Software Engineering and Design because there are multiple examples within the original code that showcases full end-to-end development and design through database modeling, client-server integration, user authentication, and debugging. It is relevant to the sort of software that I aim to build as a career developer. The specific components of the artifact demonstrating my capabilities in software development include both client side and server side. On the client side, I designed and created an Angular UI that utilizes reactive forms, route navigations, and validation to create a booking form with adjustable pricing depending on the value placed in the traveler’s field. This interface speaks to the Node/Express API that was extended to include a dedicated bookings database with CORS and preflight handling. The database was modeled in MongoDB with Mongoose that links the bookings to the trips through an object reference. The booking flow is integrated with the pre-existing JWT authentication in the original code that holds secure paths for admins to continue maintenance and updates as needed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Within my original enhancement plan, my aim was to have the enhancement for this Full Stack artifact to cover what the second course outcome is, which is Designing, developing, and delivering professional-quality oral, written, and visual communication. Reflecting on the work I have performed and all that I have done with this enhancement, I have met that goal and touched on other course outcomes as well. The polish done to the UI with clear messages and validation meets the goal of communications toward both technical and non-technical individuals. Creating a new end-to-end feature that goes through Angular, Express, and Mongo showcases software engineering and design. Creating a new Bookings collection through MongoDB that stores successfully submitted booking forms addresses the course outcome for data. I upheld a security mindset through keeping the JWT admin paths and configuring CORS and the required preflight.
  </p>

  <p>
  Reflecting on the process that I went through modifying and enhancing this artifact, I was harshly reminded that development with full stack is very much pass or fail. The slightest hiccup could and has brought the entire service down. Through my attempts to test and successfully submit a booking form, I continued to receive a repeating error. It wasn’t until I had pulled up the DevTools and looked through all the logs of traffic while navigating and testing a form submission that the error in question was due to an unhandled CORS preflight. This was addressed by adding CORS to the api path.
  </p>

  <p>
    What I had learned was the binding minDate with a validator for the date input. Which in practice, ensured that no date beyond the current calendar day could be used for scheduling purposes in the booking form itself when a form is being filled. If the attempt to use a day prior to the current calendar day is used, the button for submitting the form will become inactive and unable to push the notification until the correction is made.

  <h2>Algorithms &amp; Data Structures</h2>

  <p>
    For my second enhancement covering Algorithms and Data Structures, I have chosen to work on a project that was created in the Software Development Lifecycle course. This artifact was a resort destination slideshow created in Java. The project itself was a runnable Java file that, when executed, would display five separate slides with captioned titles and descriptions of what each image was, cycling through the images with “Next” and “Previous” buttons. I felt showcasing this project alongside others would demonstrate a well-rounded understanding of different coding languages and object-oriented programming.
  </p>

  <p>
    I chose this project for Algorithms and Data Structures for its existing logic around displaying text, images, and navigation. My enhancement added two new controls: a <strong>Random</strong> button that jumps to one of the five slides using a uniform random selection, and a <strong>Theme</strong> button that cycles the background theme for the caption container and the navigation row. These were integrated into a container that keeps captions and controls anchored at the bottom while staying in sync with the slide index via a <code>showByIndex()</code> method.
  </p>

  <p>
    These enhancements illustrate course outcomes including: designing and evaluating computing solutions using algorithmic principles; communicating technical changes clearly through UI affordances; and applying well-founded software techniques (randomized selection for non-linear navigation and cohesive state management).
  </p>

  <p>
    During implementation I hit several Java-specific issues that required research, including a warning about an unserialized class. I learned that the check ensures the class definition matches serialized bytes; adding <code>private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;</code> resolved the warning. Overall, the work deepened my comfort with Java’s syntax and UI patterns compared to languages I use more often, like Python.

  <h2>Databases</h2>

  <p>
    The original artifact for this project was built for the CS-340 Client and Server Development course. The artifact itself centers around a database access layer <code>animal_shelter.py</code> which performs CRUD methods on a dataset before launching a Jupyter Notebook dashboard that displays the collected data in an interactive table, graph, and map. The original project was completed in February of 2025.
  </p>

  <p>
    I selected this project because it showcases database engineering that extends beyond standard read and write operations. For my enhancement, I implemented <strong>bulk operations</strong> such as <code>bulk_insert()</code>, <code>bulk_update()</code>, and <code>bulk_delete()</code>, as well as an aggregation method, <code>counts_by_field()</code>. Additionally, I removed hard-coded secrets and introduced <strong>environmental variables</strong> to ensure sensitive configuration data is protected. The project was also reconfigured from its original classroom Apporto environment to a <strong>local MongoDB instance</strong> to validate data loading and end-to-end functionality.
  </p>

  <p>
    These enhancements meet my intended outcomes by strengthening the database design and demonstrating sound software engineering practices. The expanded CRUD methods show proficiency in scalable data handling, while the inclusion of environmental variables demonstrates secure coding principles and a clear security mindset.
  </p>

  <p>
    The work ultimately required far more refactoring than I initially anticipated. Since the original code was tightly coupled to a hosted classroom environment, I not only updated the Python CRUD logic but also refactored the Jupyter Notebook integration to maintain functionality across all new methods. This included installing and validating required dependencies and researching compatible package versions to ensure a smooth runtime experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    Reflecting on the process, rebuilding and reconnecting this artifact end-to-end provided a valuable learning experience. I gained practical understanding of MongoDB’s aggregation pipelines for generating meaningful summaries, and I reinforced secure development habits through proper handling of environment variables. I also learned the importance of dependency management when migrating or updating software between environments such as Apporto and local setups.
